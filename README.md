# task3-Irisclassification
This repository contains the first task completed under the BharatIntern Internship in the domain of Machine Learning.

Machine learning is almost everywhere nowadays. It’s become more and more necessary day by day. From the recommendation of what to buy to recognizing a person, robotics, everywhere is machine learning. So in this project, we’ll create the “Hello World” of machine learning which means Iris flower classification.

Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
